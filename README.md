## Hi, admin!

There are a bunch of problems when deploying some code on multiple servers in one local network. It usually needs to be automized. While switching berween _cron_ and _ansible_ there's a solution that is aimed to do all the job. It's name is *evesync*. It is now a ruby gem that allows to synchronize files and packages (`deb` and `rpm`) between multiple nodes.

Please, keep in mind, the project is in development stage and some things are not implemented now.

### EVESYNC

It's a simple tool to automate packages and files upddate on different hosts, connected to one network. You need to configure it, start the daemons, and update some of the watched objects. See the [github page](github.com/mrexox/evesync) README for more information and contact me if you are interested: [mrexox](mrexox@yahoo.com)
